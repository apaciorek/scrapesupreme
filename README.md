Using Selenium to catalog new releases on Supreme - NYC and writing to csv file

Supreme - NYC releases new items every Thursday at 11:00am EST. 

This scraper collects names, colors, descriptions, prices, availability (sold out or not), and image src for all new supreme items weekly and writes the info to csv file. 

The last row of the created csv is the date and time of scraping.

I manually change the title of the csv file before scraping every week.

Have scraped week 16 releases as of June 11, 2020 

Note: The Week 15 drop scheduled for June 4 was cancelled - no data for this week.
